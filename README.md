# AprilTag for Android

This demo app aims to provide the same set of functionality as the
[AprilTag iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apriltag/id736108128).

It supports multiple tag families, but runs an older version of the 
AprilTag libraries.

Notably, it's still missing the ability to stream tag detections over UDP.
